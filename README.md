# pokedex-study

### This is a simple pokedex application, with that we could consume the https://pokeapi.co/ API to get informations about pokemons.

To build this app I have used:
 - ReactJS with TypeScript created with vite
 - axios to fetch APIs
 - bootstrap and react-bootstrap for helping with UI and styles
 - SASS for creating and editing styles
 - react-dom to manage internal navigation
 
 ## To install and run the app you must:
  - Clone the repository and open it in any comand line terminal.
  
  To install all dependencies:
  ```
  $ yarn install
  ```
  or
  ```
  $ npm install
    
  ```
  
  - To run the dev server use:
  
  ```
  yarn dev
  ```
  or
  ```
  npm run dev
  ```
  - To build a version run:
  ```
  yarn build
  ```
  or
  ```
  npm run build
  ```
